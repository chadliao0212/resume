  【About】<br/><br/>

I am full of enthusiasm for trying new things. From work to life, I always spend time inspecting myself. I believe I can gain the experience from what I've done, and be prepared to adapt to any situation.<br/><br/><br/>


【Experience】<br/><br/>

My first job, since my college graduation, was yacht mold design. My responsibilities for the projects included but not limited to discussing the demands with customers, supervising the construction team and and handling engineering mistakes onsite. I had completed 2 yacht mold projects during my first job.

Motivated by the documentary ‘Design thinking’, my second job in Bel-Star, also my current job, is UI/UX. Bel-Star has companies in Taiwan and China. In China, our main business is printing service. And Taiwan's team focuses on the software development to provide our customers a smarter printing solutions. My tasks are planning user stories, created information architectures, as well as cooperating with software engineers to bring my UI/UX design alive. We have completed the ERP system projects for the company internal usage. Recently, I am joining the team developing the product CMS.<br/><br/>

ERP project:<br/>
The main purposes were to optimize the working process, which should resulted in higher efficiency and increased yield rates. By interviewing staffs,  we combined the off-line workflow with cloud service to make the whole process run smoothly.<br/><br/>

CMS project:<br/>
The communication problems always happen between companies and their customers, and so do us. Therefore, based on our commercial activities, we decided to provide a SaaS platform for customers. On the platform, we designed the one-stop service from submitting requests, creating document templates to printing out the results. Our customers can operate and manager the platform easily, reduce any delay or misunderstanding in the original email or instant message conversation.<br/><br/><br/>


【Other】<br/><br/>

During the time-off, I attained a book club and the Toastmaster English speech club. In the book club, I have hold several seminars regarding UX related books and the UX design workshops. In Toastmaster, I made great improvements in my English expressions skills. I also played the main vision design role for 2019 Taiwan Toastmaster annual meeting. Besides, I have done some intersting side projects with my colleague.<br/><br/><br/>


【My belief】<br/><br/>

My belief is to keep going with open-mind to fulfill myself. I expect myself to cooperate with people from different domains and combine their knowledge with my experience to complete fabulous products and services.
